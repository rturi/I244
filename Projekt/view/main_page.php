<h1 id="top_h1">This is a simple site for managing your todo lists</h1>
<p>
    You can:

    <ul>
        <li>Add new users</li>
        <li>Add, rename and delete list</li>
        <li>Add, edit (rename, change status, set due dates and add an info text) and delete tasks in said lists</li>
        <li>Search tasks</li>

    </ul>
    That's about it for the time being. Hope you like it :)
